# Job Interview Assignments for Full Stack, Back-End and Front-End Developer position


## Introduction
The task is to create a Basic Shop web application with 3 pages: Welcome, Product [CRUD][CRUD] and Shopping Cart CRUD.

We have only one task, but with options for Full Stack, Back-End and Front-End.
A Front-End developer may use localStorage and focus on the user interface, meanwhile a Back-End developer may can be 
done with RESTful-API endpoint only. Naturally a Full Stack folk should be able to progress on both side.

The reason why We combined the task for all stack is because the feature request usually does not care about the 
affinity of the developers, but the comprehensive product.

We highly recommend following the [MVP][MVP] mindset and push your prototype as soon as it  has any working function.

Are you ready?
