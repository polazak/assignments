# About Job Interview Assignments
We use this repository to support hiring process for software engineers, with test materials and personal toughs. 
We prefer to do the screening test in an open playground, although we pay attention what can be shared in a public 
repository.

You may wonder [why waste few hours][whywastefewhours] on assignments if you are not sure about the outcome. 
The simple answer is you will get a competitive job offer if you probably an A-player.
You can follow the interview process and introduce yourself as an A-player:
1. have a call with corporate recruitment. (30min)
2. have a call with an IT specialist of the field (1 hour)
3. (most probably you are here)
4. finishing the home assignments (max 8 hours)
5. a call with CEO. (30min)
6. get an offer letter (1 min) ðŸ™‚

We are able to keep hire, if we hire the right people. That is why our goal is not to fulfill open headcount ASAP, but 
make sure you are not a jerk or bozo, but a real team player.

Working in a team with A and A+ people are easy for those whom find joy in engineering challenges, who can turn off 
the outside world and flow with the task. Working in a team with A and A+ people are hard for those whom demotivates 
A-players.
